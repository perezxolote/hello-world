just another repository

Hi.
This branch is commited to the improvement of the "NonTechnicalIntroduction". The first goal is to write an effectively non technical first part, so that the reader gets first a didactical explanation -before getting into technical details and mentioning specific technologies- that allows her to understand the *principles* (decentralization, security by design,advantages of open source) that makes the cube a better product for the described aims of privacy, security and energy efficency, sepcially in comparison to other soutions on the market.
The second goal is to improve some explanations of technical details, as, for example, how the grid is constituted.
